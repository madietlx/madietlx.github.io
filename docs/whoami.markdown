Hey! My name is Marcell 👨‍💻

I was born and raised in Germany but recently moved to Maastricht, The Netherlands 🌷

I work as a *Software Architect* for a german company named [frontmark](https://www.frontmark.de), which is at the intersection of Finance and Technology, so it is fair to say that we are a FinTech company, even though the term might mean different things for different people.

Since 2018 I have been mainly responsible for building a container-based platform from scratch that we now use to develop/test/deploy various tailor-made web apps and services for our clients and ourselves. In doing so, I come across many different programming languages and technologies.

I often find the things that solve my problems or get me back on track in someone else’s blog, so I decided to host my own blog and try it. Enjoy! I hope you find something useful.

P.S. You can find my personal website with contact information and links to other social media profiles at 🔗 [www.marcell-dietl.de](https://www.marcell-dietl.de). But that's about it. There is not much else to see there.

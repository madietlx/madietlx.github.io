title:  "Why you might want to avoid building C++ applications w/ `vcpkg`"

Dockerizing üê≥ a C++ application can be much more difficult than dockerizing a Node.js or Python application. And it is not the execution of the binary that is difficult (that is easy). It's rather that compiling the source code requires a further stage in the Dockerfile, a so-called *build stage*, in which all build tools (`gcc`, `cmake`, etc.) and all dependencies (`boost`, `zlib`, etc.) must be installed and available.

To define these dependencies, one might be tempted to use `vcpkg`, a "C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS" ([https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)), which is basically the equivalent of using `npm`+`package.json` in Node.js or `pip`+`Pipfile` in Python, right?

Unfortunately, it is not. This approach leads to several problems.
<!--more-->

1. `vcpkg` feels much clumsier than a `Pipfile`, for example.
2. `vcpkg` proves to be less robust than other package managers.
3. The build step with `vcpkg` is much, much more time-consuming.

Where points 1 and 2 are also somewhat subjective, point 3 can be illustrated relatively easy.

For comparison:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madietlx/dockerfiles.git
```

```sh
make -C dockerfiles/ubuntu-20-04-compile-cxx-with-vcpkg build
```

downloads a simple example in C++, including a `Makefile` and a `Dockerfile` (build and runtime environment in one), and compiles it. You will get more or less the following output:

```sh
docker build -t built-with-vcpkg:latest .

The massive difference is almost entirely due to the time it takes to bootstrap `vcpkg` and build the dependencies. The actual build step with `cmake` is then practically the same in both cases.

The bottom line is that not using `vcpkg` leads to faster builds as well as fewer (third-party) dependencies and is accomplished solely with the package management of the operating system (here: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) üêß), which will be much more robust and less error-prone over the years.

P.S. This article was written in collaboration with a colleague of mine ([@favph](https://github.com/favph) on GitHub), who was the first to point out the disadvantages of `vcpkg` to me that then led to this article. üôè
